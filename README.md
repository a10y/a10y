Hey!

I'm an engineer who has deep experience shipping products and systems across a wide set of problem domains. Here are a few things I've worked on over the years:

* **Data analytics** - I spent years co-maintaining an internal fork of Apache Spark, finding some [bugs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-686) and fixing them upstream as well as making (sadly closed-source) changes to the query planner and core engine
* **Streaming systems** - I led a team in building a self-service data streaming platform that was used by airline, manufacturing and government customers for soft realtime applications
* **Computer Vision** - I've spent a lot of time building apps and workflows on top of commercial and open source computer vision algorithms, including fine tuning off the shelf models where appropriate. 
* **Infra** - I've stood up Terraform pipelines to automate AWS deployments, built Kubernetes operators to deploy Apache Kafka clusters, wrote observable code and used perf testing tools to speed up hot paths by >1,000x. I also built [this thing](https://blog.palantir.com/lilliput-minified-software-patches-ed4028242a5).
* **Embedded hw/sw** - I built out tooling to flash dozens of NVIDIA Tegra devices that were loaded into aircraft
* **Space** - Lots of experience in the Space industry, working with commercial (and non-commercial) satellite imagery and building new products in the GIS space. Ran code on a satellite 🚀🛰️ (yes you better believe it was in Rust!)
